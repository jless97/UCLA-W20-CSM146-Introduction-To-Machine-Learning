# CSM146, Introduction to Machine Learning, Winter 2020 

## Course Objective
Introduction to breadth of data science. Foundations for modeling data sources, principles of operation of common tools for data analysis, and application of tools and models to data gathering and analysis. Topics include statistical foundations, regression, classification, kernel methods, clustering, expectation maximization, principal component analysis, decision theory, reinforcement learning and deep learning.

## Course Description
Machine Learning encompasses the study of algorithms that learn from data. It has been a key component in a number of problem domains including computer vision, natural language processing, computational biology and robotics. This class will introduce the fundamental concepts and algorithms in machine learning (supervised as well as unsupervised learning) as well as best practices in applying machine learning to practical problems. The class consists of lectures, problem sets that contain mathematical and programming exercises and two in-class exams.
